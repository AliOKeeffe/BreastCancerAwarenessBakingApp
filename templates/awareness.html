<h4>What is Cancer?</h4>
<p>
    Cancer is a broad term for a class of diseases characterized by abnormal cells that grow and invade  healthy cells in the body.  Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast as a group of cancer cells that can then invade surrounding tissues or spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body.
</p>

<h4>What Causes Cancer to Develop</h4>
<p>
    Cancer begins in the cells which are the basic building blocks that make up tissue. Tissue is found in the breast 
    and other parts of the body.  Sometimes, the process of cell growth goes wrong and new cells form when the body doesn’t need them and old or damaged cells do not die as they should.  When this occurs, a build up of cells often forms a mass of tissue called a lump, growth, or tumor. 
</p>
<p>
    Breast cancer occurs when malignant tumors develop in the breast.  These cells can spread by breaking away from the original tumor and entering blood vessels or lymph vessels, which branch into tissues throughout the body. When cancer cells travel to other parts of the body and begin damaging other tissues and organs, the process is called metastasis.
</p>

<h4>Known Risk Factors</h4>
<p>
    Women with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop breast cancer. A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of getting a disease. Some risk factors (such as drinking alcohol) can be avoided. But most risk factors (such as having a family history of breast cancer) can’t be avoided. Having a risk factor does not mean that a woman will get breast cancer. Many women who have risk factors never develop breast cancer.

<h3 id="signs-and-symptoms">Signs and Symptoms</h3>

<h4>What Are the Symptoms and Signs of Breast Cancer?</h4>
<p>
    Every person should know the symptoms and signs of breast cancer, and any time an abnormality is discovered, it should be investigated by a healthcare professional.    

    Most people who have breast cancer symptoms and signs will initially notice only one or two, and the presence of these symptoms and signs do not automatically mean that you have breast cancer.

    By performing monthly breast self-exams, you will be able to more easily identify any changes in your breast.  Be sure to talk to your healthcare professional if you notice anything unusual.
</p>

<h4>A Change In The Breast Or Nipple Appearance</h4>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any unexplained change in the size or shape of the breast</li>
        <li>Dimpling anywhere on the breast</li>
        <li>Unexplained swelling of the breast (especially if on one side only)</li>
        <li>Unexplained shrinkage of the breast (especially if on one side only)</li>
        <li>Recent asymmetry (unequal or lack of sameness) of the breasts. Although it is common for women to have one breast that is slightly larger than the other, if the onset of asymmetry is recent, it should be checked</li>
        <li>Nipple that is turned slightly inward or inverted</li>
        <li>Skin of the breast, areola, or nipple that becomes scaly, red, or swollen or may have ridges or pitting resembling the skin of an orange</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>Any Nipple Discharge — Particularly Clear Discharge Or Bloody Discharge</h4>
<p>
    It is also important to note that a milky discharge that is present when a woman is not breastfeeding should be checked by her doctor, although it is not linked with breast cancer. Let your doctor know about any nipple discharge, clear, bloody or milky. The most concerning discharges are bloody or clear.

<h2>What is breast cancer?</h2>
<!-- source:  https://www.cancer.ie/cancer-information-and-support/cancer-types/breast-cancer -->
<p>
    Breast cancer is when cells in your breast change and grow in an abnormal way. A group
    of these cancer cells can form a tumour. Breast cancer is a common cancer in Ireland.
    More than 3,600 women and around 37 men are diagnosed with it each year.

</p>
<p>
    Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women in Ireland
    (excluding skin cancer). Most women diagnosed with breast cancer are
    over 50, but younger women can also get breast cancer.
</p>
<p>
    About 1 in 8 women are diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime.
    There's a good chance of recovery if it is detected in its early stages.

    It is recommended that women check their breasts regularly for any changes
    and always get any changes examined by their GP.
</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

<p>
    The most important symptom of breast cancer is a breast lump, which is usually painless.
    <br />
    Most breast lumps (90%) aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by your doctor.
    <br />
    Urgent advice:You should see your GP if you notice:
    a new lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast that was not there before
    a change in the size or shape of one or both breasts
    bloodstained discharge from either of your nipples
    a lump or swelling in either of your armpits
    dimpling on the skin of your breasts
    a rash on or around your nipple
    a change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast
    Breast pain is not usually a symptom of breast cancer.

    Causes
    The causes of breast cancer are not fully understood, making it difficult to say why one woman may develop breast
    cancer and another may not.

    There are risk factors known to affect your likelihood of developing breast cancer. Some of these you can't do
    anything about, but there are some you can change.

    Age
    The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age. The condition is most common among women over 50 who have
    been through the menopause. About 8 out of 10 cases of breast
    cancer cases occur in women over 50.

    All women who are 50 to 69 years of age should be screened for breast cancer every two years as part of the Breast
    Screening Programme - BreastCheck.

    Previous breast cancer or lump
    You have a higher risk of developing breast cancer again if you've previously had breast cancer. The risk is also
    higher if you've had early non-invasive cancer cell changes in
    breast ducts. This could have been either in your other breast or in the same breast.

    A benign breast lump doesn't mean you have breast cancer.

    Certain changes in your breast tissue, such as cells growing abnormally in ducts (atypical ductal hyperplasia), or
    abnormal cells inside your breast lobules (lobular carcinoma in situ),
    can make getting breast cancer more likely.

    Hormones and hormone medicine
    Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
    Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer. However, the
    risk is a very low one.

    Contraceptive pill
    Women who use the contraceptive pill have a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer. The risk starts to
    decrease once you stop taking the pill. Your risk of breast
    cancer is back to normal 10 years after stopping.

    Lifestyle factors
    Alcohol
    Alcohol is responsible for 1 in 8 breast cancers in Ireland

    Your risk of developing breast cancer increases with the amount of alcohol you drink.

    Alcohol can also increase the levels of some hormones, such as oestrogen, which can increase the risk of breast
    cancer.

    Being overweight or obese
    If you've experienced the menopause and are overweight or obese, you may be more at risk of developing breast
    cancer.

    This is thought to be linked to the amount of oestrogen in your body. Being overweight or obese after the menopause
    causes more oestrogen to be produced.

    Radiation
    Significant radiation exposure in the past may increase your risk of developing breast cancer. For example, some
    patients with Hodgkin's Lymphoma who received mantle radiation to
    the chest area

    Prevention
    As the causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood, it's not known if it can be prevented altogether.

    Some treatments are available to reduce the risk in women who have a higher risk of developing the condition than
    the general population.

    Diet and lifestyle
    Regular exercise and a healthy, balanced diet are recommended for all women. These can help prevent many conditions,
    including heart disease, diabetes and many forms of cancer.

    Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet. Although there are no definite conclusions, there
    are benefits for women who:

    maintain a healthy weight
    exercise regularly
    have a low intake of saturated fat and alcohol
    It's also been suggested that regular exercise can reduce your risk of developing breast cancer.

    If you've been through the menopause, it's particularly important that you're not overweight or obese. This is
    because these conditions cause more oestrogen to be produced by your
    body. This can increase the risk of breast cancer.

    Breastfeeding
    Studies have shown women who breastfeed are statistically less likely to develop breast cancer than those who don't.

    The reasons aren't fully understood. It could be because women don't ovulate as regularly while they're
    breastfeeding and oestrogen levels remain stable.

    Treatments to reduce your risk
    If you have a greatly increased risk of developing breast cancer, for example, a BRCA gene carrier, treatment might
    be available to reduce your risk. This applies to a very small
    minority of women.

    Your level of risk is determined by factors such as your age, your family's medical history, and the results of
    genetic tests.

    You will usually be referred to a specialist genetics service if it's thought you have a significantly increased
    risk of breast cancer. Healthcare professionals working at these
    services might discuss treatment options with you.

    The 2 main treatments are surgery to remove the breasts (mastectomy) or medication. These are described in more
    detail below.

    Mastectomy
    A mastectomy is surgery to remove the breast. It can be used to treat breast cancer and can reduce the chances of
    developing the condition in the small number of women from very high-risk
    families.

    By removing as much breast tissue as possible, a mastectomy can reduce your risk of breast cancer by up to 95%.
    However, a mastectomy does not reduce the risk of developing breast cancer
    down to zero. It is not possible to remove every single breast cell at the time of a mastectomy.

    However, like all operations, there is a risk of complications, and having your breasts removed can have a
    significant effect on your body image and sexual relationships.

    If you want to, you can usually choose to have a breast reconstruction either during the mastectomy operation or at
    a later date.

    During breast reconstruction surgery, your breast shape is recreated using either breast implants or tissue from
    elsewhere in your body.

    An alternative is to use breast prostheses. These are artificial breasts that can be worn inside your bra.

    An alternative to mastectomy is a nipple-sparing mastectomy, where the whole mammary gland is removed, but the skin
    envelope is preserved. This procedure may not be suitable
    for all women. Your surgeon can discuss this with you.

    Diagnosis
    You may be diagnosed with breast cancer after routine breast screening, or you may have symptoms that you've seen
    your GP about.

    Seeing your GP
    See your GP as soon as possible if you notice any symptoms of breast cancer. This could be an unusual lump in your
    breast or any change in the appearance, feel or shape of your breasts.

    Your GP will examine you. If they think your symptoms need further assessment, they'll refer you to a specialist
    breast cancer clinic.

    Tests at the breast cancer clinic
    If you have suspected breast cancer you'll be referred to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests. This
    referral will be because of your symptoms or because your
    mammogram has shown an abnormality,

    Mammogram and breast ultrasound
    If you have symptoms and have been referred to a specialist breast unit by your GP, you'll probably be invited to
    have a mammogram if you are over 35 years old. This is an X-ray
    of your breasts. You may also need an ultrasound scan.

    If your cancer was detected through the BreastCheck screening programme, you may need another mammogram or
    ultrasound scan.

    Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts. It helps to determine
    the nature of a lump or of the abnormality. It may be needed
    to find out if a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid.

    Your breasts are made up of thousands of tiny glands (lobules) that produce milk. This glandular tissue contains a
    higher concentration of breast cells than other breast tissue,
    making it denser.

    Dense breast tissue can make a mammogram difficult to read. Lumps or areas of abnormal tissue are harder to spot.

    Younger women tend to have denser breasts. This is why mammography is not routinely performed in women under 35
    years. As you get older, the amount of glandular tissue in your
    breasts decreases and is replaced by fat. This means your breasts become less dense.

    Biopsy
    A biopsy is where a sample of tissue cells is taken from your breast and tested to see if it's cancerous.

    You may also need a scan and a needle test on lymph nodes in your armpit (axilla) to see if these are also affected.

    Biopsies can be taken in different ways, and the type you have will depend on what your doctor knows about your
    condition.

    Needle biopsy is the most common type of biopsy. A small sample of tissue is taken from a lump in your breast using
    the ultrasound machine to help the doctor to sample the correct part.

    You'll have a local anaesthetic. You'll be awake during the procedure, but your breast will be numb.

    Your doctor may suggest that you have a mammogram guided needle biopsy. This is called a stereotactic biopsy. This
    is usually guided by a mammogram to obtain a more precise and
    reliable diagnosis of cancer.

    This also can distinguish it from any non-invasive change, particularly ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

    Further tests for breast cancer
    If a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed, more tests may be needed to determine the stage of the cancer.

    Scans and X-rays
    Computerised tomography (CT) scans or chest X-ray ultrasound scans of abdomen and bone may be needed to check if
    cancer has spread outside of the breast area. Your doctor will
    discuss with you if these are needed.

    An MRI scan of the breast may be needed to clarify the results. It may be also used to assess the extent of the
    condition within the breast.

    Stage and grade of breast cancer
    Stage of breast cancer
    When your breast cancer is diagnosed, the doctors will give it a stage. The stage describes the size of the cancer
    and how far it has spread and helps to predict the outlook.

    Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is sometimes described as stage 0. Other stages of breast cancer describe invasive
    breast cancer:

    stage is – the tumour is "in situ" and there's no evidence of invasion (pre-invasive)
    stage 1 – the tumour measures less than 2cm and the lymph nodes in the armpit aren't affected; there are no signs
    that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body
    stage 2 – the tumour measures 2-5cm, the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected, or both; there are no signs that
    the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body
    stage 3 – the tumour measures 2-5cm and may be attached to structures in the breast, such as skin or surrounding
    tissues, and the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected; there
    are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body
    stage 4 – the tumour is of any size and the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis)</p>
